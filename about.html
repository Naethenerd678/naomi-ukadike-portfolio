    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
    <p>My name is Naomi.I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Information Technology in my
      second year. This is my second year and as my first year was last year. Before
      Information Technology, I was a nursing major at Chattahoochee Technical
      College before I transfered here last year. My journey so far has been a
      life-changing and a really eye-opening experience as i have had the privilege
      and oppourtunity to experience the campus life while living on campus and
      having more access to resources, events, career fairs, and activities that I
      would not be able to experience outside of College. Kennesaw was the type of
      college that I had dreamed of going with a range of opportunites and a chance
      for students to blossom and make real life connections and bonding experiences
      to where I have come out my shell a little bit. 
      I am 21 years old living on
      the Marietta Campus. I am Nigerian-american as my parents were born in
      Nigeria. I was born in Georgia and lived there all my life. I was actually
      born in Marietta and lived in Smyrna for some time. I grew up in a christian
      background, so i would consider myself a christian. I am very introverted and
      shy and enjoy and prefer spending time alone so I can recharge. I am slowly
      come out of my shell and making more friends and connections here on campus as
      I am also trying to find myself by exploring many different opportunities to
      pursue in the only time I have in life in college.
