      <p>
        Hey! My name is Naomi! This is my home page containing all the
        interesting information about my journey and experience being in KSU so
        far. I am a sophomore currently pursuing a Bachelors' In Information
        Technolgy. I transferred from a different institution from a different
        major which was nursing and I have been pursuing this major since last
        year of Spring 2023 during my freshman year.
