    Welcome to my Portfolio! Hey! My name is Naomi! This is my home page
    containing all the interesting information about my journey and experience
    being in KSU so far. I am a sophomore currently pursuing a Bachelors' In
    Information Technolgy. I transferred from a different institution from a
    different major which was nursing and I have been pursuing this major since
    last year of Spring 2023 during my freshman year. Naomi Ukadike| Kennesaw
